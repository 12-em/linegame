# Linegame
Wrote my own 3D renderer. Using it to make a game.

## Installation
### Debian-based
```shell
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libglm-dev
git clone https://github.com/12-em/linegame
cd linegame
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Windows
I have no idea how to do it for Windows. If anyone has an idea, feel free to open an issue.
